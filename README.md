Handwritten Digit Recignition:-
Digits are a part of our everyday life,be it License plate on our cars or bike, the price of a product, speed limit on a road, or details associated with a bank account. In the case of a text which is unclear, it is easier to guess the digits in comparison to the alphabets

Machine Learning and Deep Learning are reducing human efforts in almost every field. Moreover, a solution achieved using ML and DL can power various applications at the same time, thereby reducing human effort and increasing the flexibility to use the solution. One such solution is a handwritten digit recognition system that can be used in postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry, etc.

Convolutional Neural Network:-
A Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a Deep Learning Algorithm which is very effective in handling image classification tasks. It is able to capture the Temporal and Spatial dependencies in an image with the help of filters or kernels.The kernel is just like a small window sliding over the large window in order to extract the spatial features and in the end, we get feature maps.

MNSIT Dataset:-
In this project i used mnsit dataset for training CNN model.The MNIST dataset was compiled with images of digits from various scanned documents and then normalized in size. Each image is of a dimension, 28Ã—28 i.e total 784 pixel values.
